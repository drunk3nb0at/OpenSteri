Wiki on Sterilization (esp, bilateral salpingectomy) #Tech4Good #Feminism #ReproductiveJustice

Not medical advice. Just sharing resources I found useful.

## Sterilization

#### What is sterilization?

A **permanent method** of birth control. 

#### Does sterilization prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs)？

**No!**

## Salpingectomy

[What is a salpingectomy?](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21879-salpingectomy)

#### Bilateral salpingectomy vs Tubal ligation

**Bilateral salpingectomy** is the standard procedure.

The ACOG writes in their Committee Opinion updated April 2019:

[ACOG Committee Opinion No. 774: Opportunistic Salpingectomy as a Strategy for Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Prevention](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30913199/)

> Salpingectomy as a means of tubal sterilization appears to be safe and does not increase the risk of complications such as blood transfusions, readmissions, postoperative complications, infections, or fever compared with tubal ligation.
